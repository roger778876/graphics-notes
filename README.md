## 1/31 Peering into the depths of color

***Color Depth***
- the amount of data used to represent a single pixel
  - 1 bit: 1 color, on or off
  - 2 bit: 1 color, on or off + 4 levels of intensity
  - 3 bit: RGB, on or off
  - 4 bit: RGB + intensity
  - 6 bit: RGB, each has its own intensity
  - 3 byte: RGB, each with 256 intensities
    - our current color depth

***Other Color Spaces***
- RGBa: alpha for transparency
- HSB: hue, saturation, brightness
  - shown as color cone
  
***Image File Formats***
- Raster vs. Vector:
  - Raster images are grids of pixels
  - Vector images are series of drawing instructions
    - infinitely scalable
    - geometric shapes
    - hard to use for real-world objects
    - ex: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
